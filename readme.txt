SEA concept dataset generated by Street and Kim in 2001 [1].

There are 60,000 samples with 3 attributes and 2 classes. 
Attributes are numeric values between 0 and 10, however, only the first two are relevant. 

In SEA Concept, there are four concepts with three drift points, 15,000 examples each. 
The dataset has around 10% noise.
